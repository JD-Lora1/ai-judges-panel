It works by training algorithms on large datasets, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. There are three main types:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn mappings between inputs and outputs
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples  
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties

Common applications include recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. The key advantage is that ML systems can adapt and improve over time as they process more data."""
