There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn mappings between inputs and outputs. Examples include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. This includes clustering (grouping similar data points), dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning. Examples include K-means clustering and principal component analysis.

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment. The agent learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This is used in game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.

Each type serves different purposes and is suited for different kinds of problems, making machine learning a versatile tool for solving complex data-driven challenges."""

3. Industrial Processes: Manufacturing, cement production, and chemical processes emit various greenhouse gases including CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide.

4. Agriculture: Livestock farming produces methane through digestion, while rice paddies and fertilizer use release methane and nitrous oxide.

5. Transportation: Cars, trucks, ships, and planes burn fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global emissions.

These activities have increased atmospheric CO2 levels by over 40% since pre-industrial times, leading to global warming and associated climate changes.""",
